/**
 * Comparator.
 * For two numerical expressions x and y, gives 1 if x > y, -1 if x < y, and 0
 * if x == y. This is useful for instance in a qsort comparator callback.
 * Furthermore, compilers are able to optimize this to branchless code, and
 * there is no risk of overflow with signed types.
 * As with many macros, this evaluates its argument multiple times, it thus
 * must not have a side-effect.
