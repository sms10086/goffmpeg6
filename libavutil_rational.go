 * Rational number calculation.
 *
 * While rational numbers can be expressed as floating-point numbers, the
 * conversion process is a lossy one, so are floating-point operations. On the
 * other hand, the nature of FFmpeg demands highly accurate calculation of
 * timestamps. This set of rational number utilities serves as a generic
 * interface for manipulating rational numbers as pairs of numerators and
 * denominators.
 *
 * Many of the functions that operate on AVRational's have the suffix `_q`, in
 * reference to the mathematical symbol "â„š" (Q) which denotes the set of all
 * rational numbers.
